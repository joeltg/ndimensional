            <p>"Transcluding" is a word Ted Nelson made up to describe a thing that is both a quote and a hyperlink (or "jump link" if you have no friends).</p>
            <p>Usually we don't do that because it's only possible with iframes and those are scary.</p>
            <p>But hold my beer, imma transclude some stuff with WebComponents!</p>
            <p>Here's <a href="thing-one.html">Thing One</a> transcluded from this root thing:</p>
            <html-import shadow href="thing-one.html"></html-import>
            <p>And here's <a href="thing-two.html">Thing Two</a> transcluded from this root thing:</p>
            <html-import shadow href="thing-two.html"></html-import>
